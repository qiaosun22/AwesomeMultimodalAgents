# AwesomeMultimodalAgents
This is a repository for easier keeping abreast of the most cutting-edge LLM-based Multimodality and Inteligent Agents.

# Definition & Distinguish

## Multimodal LLM


## Multimodal Agents

## Embodied Agents
These models are required to have 3D understanding and navigation ability (as "body" is in the 3D space), and better sequential decision surpport.
